# green-your-impact

An app that rewards your effort to reduce impact on global warming

# Explaining the application

So far...

1. **Users** can create and an **Event**
      - Private or public
      - The event describes what they did
      - E.g. Public event, biked, 10km (TODO: work out carbon saved)
2. TODO: have other events like recycling etc.
3. Authentication with social platforms

## How this works

- Split into two frameworks.
- Backend: Django REST framework (DRF) - this will communicate between database and external clients through API.
- Frontend: ReactJS - this will be what users will see, can also turn ReactJS into Progressive Web Application for mobile with biometrics
- Mobile?: React Native - but hopefully not since we are creating a Progressive Web Application
